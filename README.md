# CS50's Introduction to computer science

In 2019 I completed the self-paced cs50 introduction to computer science course. This project shows some of the exercises and problem sets I completed.

### CS50 Overview

An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, is Harvard's largest course.
